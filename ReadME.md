# Weather Forecast

## Client Needs:
- The client travels regularly and would like a website where they can view the weather of multiple cities.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- When the user searches for a city, they should be presented with the current weather and the city should be saved in the search history.
    - This was done by allowing the user to search for a city and after the weather information is displayed, the city is displayed under the search bar.
- When the weather conditions are displayed it should show the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed.
    - After the city is searched for, all of the current conditions are displayed to the right of the screen.
- The client would also like to be presented with a five day forecast for future plans in the area.
    - When the current weather information is displayed, it will also show the next five days undernearth with dates to label them.
